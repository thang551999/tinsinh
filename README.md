# iCarPS
iCarPS: a computational tool for identifying protein carbonylation sites by novel encoded features.
iCarPS provides a machine-learning method for carbonylation site prediction. It is implemented by WEKA library--random forest. At present, it provides user-friendly webserver to predict query protein sequences, refering to http://lin-group.cn/server/iCarPS/webServer.html. Here we also provide our codes for researches who would like to run locally and conveniently to predict the query protein sequences in bulk.
