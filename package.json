  "description": "iCarPS provides a machine-learning method for carbonylation site prediction. It is implemented by WEKA library--random forest. At present, it provides user-friendly webserver to predict carbonylation sites freely, refering to http://lin-group.cn/server/iCarPS/webServer.html. Here we also provide our source codes for researchers who would like to run locally and conveniently to predict the query protein sequences in bulk.",
